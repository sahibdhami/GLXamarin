# GLXamarin

If you are new to Xamarin and wanted to know how the things should be. It has following key things
1. Use of controls like label button and tableview programatically.
2. Use of async, await.
3. Use of SQLite to display data.
4. Use of REST API calls for displaying json data.
5. Division of logic across business layer, data access layer, ViewModel.
6. Use of interface to switch between different type of data (SQLIte or json etc)

Please, excuse look and feel :-)
